The objective of the Genome Aggregation Database Consortium ("the Consortium") encompasses the collection of exome sequencing data (through an effort previously known as the Exome Aggregation Consortium or ExAC) as well as whole-genome sequencing data, and to apply variant calling to such data from tens of thousands of samples. The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is to codify the terms of participation for researchers who have contributed individual sequencing data to the Consortium ("Participant"). By signing this MOU, participants agree to the following principles:

1. Participant will provide exome and/or genome sequencing data and information on sample case/control status, age, sex and ancestry ("Data") to The Broad Institute, Inc. ("Broad") for use by the Consortium.

2. Participant certifies that it has the right to provide the Data to Broad for Consortium use and that the use complies with all applicable ethical regulations including those imposed by the US OHRP, NIH and other national policy organizations.

3. Broad shall use the Data solely for the creation of frequency reference databases and for no other purpose without Participant’s prior written consent.

4. Broad will not transfer genotype data – either the sequence data provided by Participant, or individual genotypes – to any third party without Participant’s prior written consent.

5. Broad agrees to use the Data in compliance with all applicable regulations, including NIH regulations and guidelines.

6. Broad will aggregate the Data together with exome/genome data from other participants and perform simultaneous variant calling (joint calling) across the full data set.

7. Upon conclusion of each round of joint calling, Broad will provide a summary of the Results to all Participants. The term "Results" include (1) new variant and genotype calls for the samples provided by Participant to be made available on request; and (2) a summary file containing a list of variant sites, allele frequencies, and gene-level summaries, generated from all samples in the project will be automatically returned to all Participants.

8. Broad will make the Results available through a freely accessible online portal, which will allow querying of specific genes/variants and allow the complete download of the complete summary file in computer-readable format. No individual genotype or sequence data will be available from this portal.

9. Any Results delivered pursuant to this Agreement are understood to be experimental in nature and provided "as is." Broad makes no representations and extends no warranties of any kind regarding the Results.

10. Publicly released data will be accompanied by a usage statement that permits free use and publication of Consortium frequency data.

11. No Participant shall use the name or any trademark owned by Broad or another Participant in any promotional material or other public announcement or disclosure without the prior written consent of the owner of the name or mark in question. In the case of Broad, prior written consent is to be given by its Office of Communications.

12. Participants in this MOU are not limited in any way in the use and publication of their own data.

13. The genetic information described here may be hosted on an access controlled platform developed and managed by the Broad on a public cloud compute and storage environment. Google Cloud Compute environment is a highly secured environment that undergoes several independent third party audits on a regular basis to provide independent verification of security, privacy and compliance controls and is accredited with a FISMA moderate security level. In the future, Broad may use other cloud storage vendors that have equivalent security measures to host these data.
