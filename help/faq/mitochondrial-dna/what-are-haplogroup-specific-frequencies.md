question: 'What are haplogroup-specific frequencies?'
---

For each variant, we report the overall population frequency across all gnomAD samples as well as frequencies within all individuals of a given haplogroup (top-level haplogroups only, nomenclature is per van Oven et al Human Mutation 2009). We note more specific haplogroups cannot be reported due to data use restrictions. Variants are displayed relative to the GRCh38 reference genome, which contains the rCRS mitochondrial sequence which belongs to haplogroup H2a2a1 (within the top-level haplogroup H).
