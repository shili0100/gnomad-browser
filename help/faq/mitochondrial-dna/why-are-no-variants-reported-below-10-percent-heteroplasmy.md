question: 'Why are no variants reported below 10% heteroplasmy?'
---

In gnomAD v3.1 we chose to filter out variants with heteroplasmy below 10%, since low heteroplasmy variants are enriched for sequencing/PCR errors, mis-alignment of NUMTs, and contamination. We anticipate that future releases may include lower heteroplasmy variants as we continue to improve our variant filters and quality control.
