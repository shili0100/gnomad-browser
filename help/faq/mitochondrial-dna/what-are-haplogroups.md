question: 'What are haplogroups?'
---

mtDNA does not recombine and is inherited maternally. mtDNA sequences have historically been grouped together based on sequence similarity into "haplogroups.". There are over 5000 haplogroups from diverse populations available in the [Phylotree](https://www.phylotree.org/) database. Each gnomAD sample is assigned to a specific haplogroup via [Haplogrep](https://github.com/seppinho/haplogrep-cmd).
