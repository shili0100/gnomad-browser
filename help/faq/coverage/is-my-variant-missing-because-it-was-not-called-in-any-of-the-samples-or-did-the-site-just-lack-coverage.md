question: 'Is my variant missing because it was not called in any of the samples or did the site just lack coverage?'
---

The best way to tell if a variant is missing because of a lack of coverage vs missing because it is actually absent in all gnomAD samples is to check the coverage at that base position. You can obtain coverage files from our downloads page. If you are using the browser, a region search will still display coverage plots for zero-variant sites, which can help distinguish between sites that lack variants and sites that could not be called because of a lack of coverage.
