question: 'Are all the individuals in the Exome Variant Server included?'
---

No. We were not given permission from NHLBI to include individuals from several of the cohorts included in the NHLBI's Exome Sequencing Project. As a result, genuine rare variants that are present in the [Exome Variant Server](https://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) may not be observed in gnomAD.
