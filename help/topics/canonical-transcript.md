title: Ensembl canonical transcript
---

The canonical transcript is generally the longest transcript, though not necessarily the most biologically relevant. It is defined in the [Ensembl glossary](https://ensembl.org/Help/Glossary).

Please note, Ensembl will soon use [MANE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/) Select, when available, as the default/primary transcript for reporting annotations.
