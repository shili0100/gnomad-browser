Some known pathogenic loci have additional adjacent repeat sequences. ExpansionHunter can  simultaneously estimate the size of the main repeat locus along with the size of the adjacent repeat loci and this sometimes improves the accuracy of both estimates. The adjacent repeat genotypes are included in the browser for researchers who are interested in studying the variation in these adjacent loci and how they correlate with the size of the main pathogenic locus. Read visualizations provide additional information in that they phase the genotypes of the main and adjacent loci.
