Ranges of repeats were collected from [Depienne 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33811808/), [STRipy](https://stripy.org/database), [OMIM](https://www.omim.org/), [GeneReviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1116/), and other primary literature. We found that for most loci, sources disagree and/or exact thresholds are not yet known. We therefore warn users that these thresholds are approximate and may change over time as the loci are better studied and correlated to phenotype.
