title: "Age Distribution"
---

The x-axis represents the number of repeats detected by ExpansionHunter in both the short and long alleles of each genotype at this locus. The y-axis represents the individualsâ€™ age. Please note that cohorts vary in how they report age (e.g. age at enrollment, age at diagnosis, age of last visit, etc.), so the ages associated with the gnomAD data can be thought of as the last reported age of the individual. The Age Distribution includes only a subset of the alleles present in the Allele Size Distribution because age information is only known for 9,895 out of 19,241 (51%) of individuals in the dataset.
