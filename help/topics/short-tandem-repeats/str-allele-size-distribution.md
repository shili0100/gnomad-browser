The x-axis represents the number of repeats detected by ExpansionHunter in both the short and long allele of each genotype at this locus. The y-axis represents the number of alleles found to have that particular number of repeats. Each individual contributes 2 counts to the distribution - 1 for the long allele and 1 for the short allele - except at STR loci on the X chromosome where male genotypes are hemizygous and so contribute only 1 count.
