The markers to the right of the transcript tracks show each transcript's mean expression across all tissues. Larger markers correspond to higher expression. Hovering over one of the markers shows the transcript's mean expression as well as the tissue in which the transcript is most expressed.

Transcript expression was calculated from [GTEx v7](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets#datasetDiv6) [RNA-Seq data](https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets#filesetFilesDiv64). For more information about GTEx, visit [gtexportal.org](https://gtexportal.org).
